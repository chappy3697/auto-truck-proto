        <h3 class="heading-medium">Why is the service being introduced?</h3>
      <p>
With the advancement of autonomous vehicles, the UK government has introduced a new law that requires companies that own autonomous trucks for goods distribution to have licenses for their trucks, the law is currently in a beta stage and is only open to large companies at this time. Only 3 truck manufacturers are currently producing autonomous trucks; Volvo, Mercedes and Daimler. 
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 class="heading-medium">What is the service?</h3>
      <p>
        A new licence/service that allows a company to apply for a single licence to register their entire fleet of autonomous trucks. 
        </p>
